# Product Aggregator Service

### Requirement
two separate microservices serving this purpose:
-   one to read products data from a CSV file (Importer) and wrap them into a JSON
object for the other service to consume ;
-   the second to save and maintain the product data received and provide some
statistics about them (Aggregator) .

-   The first service (the Importer ) would be a simple stateless service that reads a CSV
file containing all the data regarding products and sends them as messages on a
message broker of your choice or using restful calls.
-   The second service (the Aggregator ) will handle incoming product messages to
create a new product if it doesnâ€™t exist in its database, and update it if it was already
there.

## Note
-   Completed cration of both micro services for importing and aggregating
-   Coding is in progress for adding message broker to pass data from importer
service to aggregator services. It will be submitted by today EOD.

## Solution
-   First microservices (product-importer-service) parse the excel for data.
You can add more test data by running the test case -ProductImporterServiceApplicationTests
Before executing the test case, add the the respective CSV file under resources/template/dataExample1.csv
Then execute the data
    * At the time of starting up the application, system default load 1000 products from
    the CSV dataExample.csv.
    
-   Second microservices (product-aggregator-service) aggregate the incoming
products and save to in memory H2-DB. The micro services have different API
as below:
*   http://localhost:8080/products (POST) - to save products
*   http://localhost:8080/products/ (GET) - Providing an endpoint to list all available products in its database.
*   http://localhost:8080/products/statistics (GET) - Providing an endpoint to show daily statistics of how many products were
                                            created and how many updated. Default takes current month as return statistics
*   http://localhost:8080/products/statistics/{data} (GET) - Providing an endpoint to list 
all available products in its database. Return the stats for the given date.
